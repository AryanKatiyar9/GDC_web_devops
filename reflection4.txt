1. Approach:
- I structured the form using HTML `<form>` elements with appropriate input fields, labels, and placeholders. I added the `required` attribute for validation.
- For the table, I used `<table>`, `<thead>`, and `<tbody>` elements to organize the data. Each user entry is in a separate `<tr>` with `<td>` for columns.
- Added an `<hr>` to separate the form and table visually.
- Styled the form and table minimally for clarity.

2. Challenges:
- Ensuring proper alignment of form inputs and labels was tricky initially. I resolved it by using `<br>` tags for spacing.
- Understanding form validation required experimentation with the `required` attribute.

3. Learning:
- Gained a better understanding of how forms work, including different input types and their attributes.
- Learned how to structure and style tables effectively.
- Improved debugging skills by resolving minor validation issues.
